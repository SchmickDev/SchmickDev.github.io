            I'm a junior dev with junior dev problems one day hoping to be a senior dev width
            senior dev problems. This is a place where I have chosen to put my thoughts in order
            to make them more concrete, and possibly help someone along the way.

            I currently work in web dev, specializing in Java, JavaScript/Typescript, and React.
            My programming passions and likes outside of my job include studying and learing 
            about various programming paradigms, how they apply design philosophies and principles.
            I enjoy wrtiting Common Lisp, not enough to call myself a lisper, but enough to look 
            into Clojure as an alternative JVM language.

            Yes this website looks like it out of 1998, it is designed to convey meaning, not 
            conform to whatever the most recent fad/trend in UX is, not that I would be great 
            at that anyway. I will also never track or solicit you. I'm not even sure if I will
            add any functionality with JavaScript at this point. It was created with HTML and 
            tailwind. It is in a single column because that is the simplest way to make a website
            responsive and not fall apart on mobile.

            Lastly this website operates in an opinionated dark-ish theme.
