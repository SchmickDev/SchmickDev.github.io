            I am writing this for 2 reasons. First I have found
            that there is a distinct lack of comprehensive free
            information about Java that assumes that the person learing
            does not have any prior knowlege of the platform. All of
            the material that assumes zero knowlege ends up being quite
            shallow, and much of the material discussing more in depth
            topics assumes a great deal of prior knowlege. I would like
            to attempt to hit the sweet spot with this. Starting from
            scratch and eventually getting to the point where we are
            discussing more in depth material. Secondly I am writing
            this to make my own knowleege more concrete and orgranized.
            One of the best ways to ensure that you know something is
            to teach it and that is what I am attempting to do here.

        <h2 class="text-2xl py-1" font-sans>What About Javas Reputation?</h2>
        <p class="pb-4">
            Java has gotten a fairly negative connotation in recent
            years, especially with newer programmers. I believe this
            is for a few reasons. The first being that its verbose,
            sometimes overly so. While this is often seen as a bad thing
            it is also a strength. Once you understand the basic syntax
            and some of the core API's (Application Programming Interface)
            it is rare that you will see a line of code and go "Wait
            what exactly does that do?" or not be able to look up the
            documentation and get a good idea of what is going on.
            This is not neccessarily the case with other languages.
            The other big reason why I think Java has a more negative
            connotation when compared to some newer langauges is that
            it was released in 1995 and to this day is still mostly
            backwards compatible. This means that it has some baggage
            and there are probably some design aspects that would
            be done differently with 25+ more years of experience.
            Shortcomings which other languages saw and were able to
            remedy but Java had to find a way to rectify while not
            breaking existing code. So if I am admitting Java has
            shorcomings due to this what is the benifit? The backwards
            compatibility story with Java is extrememly strong. That
            means the core API's are extremely stable, incrememnting
            version to version is fairly easy, and code written today
            is still likely to be able to be run in 20 years on a much
            newer Java version. This is one of the biggest reasons to
            choose Java, and businesses have reflected this.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl py-1" font-sans>Why Not Java?</h2>
        <p class="pb-4">
            Despite this series assuming that the reader does not know
            anything about programmin Java is not my first language of
            choice for teaching new programmers. That would probably go
            to Python. Java follows a paradigm called OOP (Object
            Oriented Programming) which requires some ceremony to get
            simple things up and running. We will dive into OOP and what
            it means later but learning from scratch will require some
            hand waving at the beginning. Java is also not the best
            choice for every problem. Scripting (Short Programs which
            generally accomplish a single thing or automate something)
            is not something that Java is strong at. We will use shorter
            programs to illustrate concepts and learn but typically if
            I need to write a 100 - 200 line program professionally
            which is used to accomplish a single task every once in a
            while Java is not the language that I reach for.
            Java is also not the right choice if you need ultimate
            performance. If nano seconds count or memory is extremely
            confined (such as with many embedded devices) Java probably
            is not the corect choice.
        </p>            
        <h2 class="text-2xl py-1" font-sans>So Why Java?</h2>
        <p class="pb-4">
            So what is Java good at. Java is an adequately fast, easy
            to run language that works well at scale and is widely used.
            Lets break down what this means. Java is adequately fast.
            While Java may not be as fast as some other languages like
            C or C++ (or some of the new languages on the block like
            Rust or Zig) it is adequately fast. What I mean by that is
            that with proper programming practices you should not notice
            a lack of responsiveness for common things. Thats a lot of word
            salad to say its fast enough for most things. Its easy to
            run. I have several windows and linux machines at home,
            and I use a mac professionally. I have never had an issue
            running Java on any of them. Compared to something like
            C Java is quite portable between operating systems. One
            of the original taglines of Java was "Write once, run
            anywhere" and while there have been reports of this being
            exagerated, I have found that with modern Java it is
            almost entirely true. Java works well at scale. This is a
            pretty simple one but one that some may find controversial
            so you can take this one as my opinion. Java works well
            in "large" codebases. I say large in quotes because everything
            is subjective, but what I mean by this is some of the
            language design choices when applied correctly make working
            in a codebase over 50 thousands lines easier. Additionally
            the tooling is readily available and facilitates this
            as well. 50 thousand lines may not be large to some and to
            others may be immeasurable. The number is not what is important
            the important part is that the design and tooling support
            working in arbitrarily large codebases. Java is widely used.
            Java is widely used in professional industry and does not
            seem to be waning any time soon. Javas period of growth seems
            to have ended, but its usage does not seem to be declining.
            I attribut this to its focus on backwards compatibility
            and stability which make it an attractive choice for a
            company looking to make decisions about its tech stack.

        <h2 class="text-2xl py-1" font-sans>How to Use these Articles</h2>
        <p class="pb-4">
            Use these to learn from scratch and as you progress these
            can be used for snippets/examples.
        </p>            
        <h2 class="text-2xl py-1" font-sans>Anything Else?</h2>
        <p class="pb-4">
            If you are new to Java, but not to programming you may want
            to skip some of these sections as neccessary. We will also
            be discussing theory and design somewhat as they are applicable.
            We may take a detour into other languages from time to time
            especially when we get to more advanced topics to compare how
            things are done. Now lets get started.
