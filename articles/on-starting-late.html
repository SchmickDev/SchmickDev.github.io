        <p>
            It took me a long time to "become" a developer. I initially went to
            college for music, specifically guitar. Then after not applying myself
            very well I was part of a somewhat successful band (at least successful
            enough to have toured the country). Then being in my early 20s with no
            college degree I turned to the restaurant industry. I very quickly
            realized that I did not want to remain in the restaurant industry as a
            career but lacked the motivation to do anything about it. After 7 years
            I finally returned to school. This time with the intention of getting a
            degree in history and becoming a school teacher. I attended my local
            community college earning my associates. After getting my associates I
            decided that I wanted to retire before I was 85 and I decided to switch
            majors. I remembered enjoying computer math in high school, and Amazon
            just announced that they were bringing thousands of jobs
            to my area. So I switched into Computer Science. I dont currently work
            at Amazon, but I am gainfully employed and happy with my job. Switching
            into computer science was one it was one of the best decisions that I
            have made for both me and my family. There are several things I have
            learned along the way which may be of use to someone. If not they can
            sit here as my ramblings as I rapidly approach old man yells at cloud.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="text-2xl" font-sans>Do You Need Prior Knowledge?</h2>
        <p>
            In short no. When I decided to change my major from history to Computer
            Science I had not programmed anything in about 13 years. To the point
            where I had forgotten anything that I had ever learned in relation to
            the subject. If you are thinking of switching careers (especially if you
            are going the college route) I would say that you probably should know
            whether or not you will sufficiently enjoy the field you are switching
            into. I can not speak the boot camp or self-taught route because I did
            not take those, but traditional Computer Science education is pretty
            heavy on Math in addition to the Computer Science courses. Before
            diving into a degree I would ask yourself if you have at least the
            ability to sit through material up to multivariate calculus, and maybe
            poke around a programming book to see if you enjoy programming and the
            theory behind it enough to go through a 4-year degree.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="text-2xl" font-sans>Do You Need a Wiz bang Computer?</h2>
        <p>
            Definitely not. I completed the majority of my degree on a 10.5" laptop
            with 4 gb of ram and a Intel Celeron processor (not that I recommend this).
            You may need some more powerful hardware for some of the more advanced
            courses but assuming that you have a computer made in the last decade it
            is probably sufficient to get through the majority of a Computer Science
            degree. If you have decided that you want to switch careers then do not
            let this be what holds you back.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            * The one caveat to this is that some front end frameworks can be quite
            resource intensive while running development servers. For those instances
            a computer that was made 10 years ago may not cut it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="text-2xl" font-sans>Time Management is King</h2>
        <p>
            Time management rules. As someone in my late 20s/early 30s attending
            school the most difficult classes were not those with difficult
            material, but rather those which had a large quantity of work. My
            networking class in particular was one of the most difficult classes
            which I took. Why? Because there was just a ton of work. None of the
            work was particularly difficult, but finding the time to fit in
            everything while managing other responsibilities was quite difficult.
            Working a full time job, while having other family commitments made
            time management one of the most important skills for my success upon
            returning to school. Along with this I found habits and dedicated study
            time to be incredibly important. I worked as a bartender Friday -
            Monday, all nights. This meant that Tuesday - Thursday I could study.
            Generally speaking I would work on things on Tuesday - Thursday for at
            least 4 hours a day and more if needed. If nothing was due I would work
            ahead because I did not have the luxury of working on a project for 12
            hours a day for 7 days straight to meet an assignment deadline. When
            you have real world obligations like a house, a job, and family you
            have to ensure that those are met first and then you have time to fit
            school (or self study) in between the cracks. In order to maximize
            what you get out of this time management is key.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="text-2xl" font-sans>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            The only factor that I would say was more important in my success was
            motivation. The drive to not allow myself to fail was imperative.
            I had been in my current employment situation for far too long and
            was finally sick of it, enough to actually do something about it.
            Enough where I wanted to go out and provide a better life for myself
            and my family. This meant I really could not fail. I did not have time
            too. If I failed a course that meant I would have to retake it, which
            meant ~$1500 and another semester in school. That was 6 more months
            that I would be stuck in the same position I was at. This was one of
            the key differences in me going back to school. I was far more
            motivated. I think this advice is important to anyone attending school,
            or attempting to learn something new. Finding motivation is key.
            Finding some reason why you will continue to work towards a goal is
            extremely important to success regardless of what that goal is. I am not
            going to tell you where to find your motivation. I can tell you that
            contrary to a lot of tech influencers it does not necessarily have to
            be the love of programming. Now I think if you can not stand
            programming and you absolutely hate it then it is probably not a great
            idea to just get into it for the money, but if you like it well enough
            I think something like providing a better life for you and your family
            can be sufficient motivation to succeed. If you are younger,
            chase your passions, you have time to fail.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="text-2xl" font-sans>Reasonable Expectations</h2>
        <p>
            As someone older switching into the tech industry you have some
            advantages. You have life experience. Ideally you have non tech
            related workplace experience, showing that you know how to function
            as an employee. When applying to jobs I put the entirety of my work
            history down despite none of it being related to computers. I got more
            than one interview where the interviewer or recruiter told me that my
            resume was selected because it was interesting. Not because I had the
            most impressive projects, not because I graduated from the most
            impressive school but because I had an interesting resume. It showed
            life experience and that I knew how to function in a workplace. If you
            are someone older getting into tech these things can set you apart
            from other candidates, especially your peers who are also just
            graduating.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            On the flip side once you do get a job impostor syndrome is still a
           real thing. But you have come this far, so why stop learning now?
            One of the difficulties that I have encountered is finding time to
            accelerate my learning. If I were 22 fresh out of school even with a
            full time job I would be able to sink an extra 20 hours a week into
            learning and honing my programming skills. But as someone who is a
            little older this may be harder to do. I'm in my mid 30s and have many
            of the responsibilities that people in their mid 30s have. Taking care
            of the house, talking the kids to birthday parties, changing the oil in
            my wife's car. I would not change any of these, but the reality is that
            these take time, and if you have less time then someone (most likely
            younger than you) will pass you by in skill and possibly position.
            That's something that I have had to figure out how to deal with.
            I will probably not be the next John Carmack, I will probably not be
            the best programmer at my company, and I will probably not contribute
            anything meaningful to the field of Computer Science. None of these
            things stop me from being good at my job or being happy, and none of
            these things change the fact that I am in a better place after having
            switched careers. In up scaling yourself see point 1 Time Management is
            King. As it turns out this did not really change after I graduated.

        <h2 class="text-2xl" font-sans>You Know Nothing</h2>
        <p>
            Ok, you graduated, got a job, showed up on your first day, and then
            your coworkers start talking. What are they talking about? what is
            GraphQL and where does it live? How did I get a full stack development
            job? What's a React component? What is a JSP file and why does it look
            like if was invented to confuse me? Why are there so many acronyms? What
            doe these acronyms mean? Why are there acronyms for things that probably
            should not have acronyms? WHY DOES JavaScript NOT KNOW HOW TO SORT AN
            ARRAY OF NUMBERS? Can someone please explain this to me like I'm 5? Very
            quickly you will realize that there are parts, sometimes entire sections
            of the tech stack which you just have no clue about. This is fine, It
            is normal. The tech landscape at this point is so wide that it is
            impossible to know everything even 20 years into your career. The
            flip side of this is that when you are first starting with practical
            application of what you have learned, you really do not know anything.
            One of the big shocks to me was when I pulled cloned my first back end
            service repo. The back end for my company is written in Java, which is a
            language that I was familiar with. To my shock it looked completely
            alien. I had not seen functional Java before and the entirety of the
            streams API was new to me. Thankfully due to some functional programming
            classes that which I had taken I was able to pick up that almost
            immediately. In addition to that there were annotations everywhere, what
            they did was a complete mystery, as was the method in which they worked
            (reflection). So I started researching and asking questions. Asking
            someone for a general lay of the land and what technologies that we
            use was critical. From there I would just read the source code and
            google when I encountered a problem which I didn't know the answer to.
            If it was something structural/architectural or related to an internal
            framework I would ask someone my senior. I spent time learning
            everything I could to get me up to speed. Almost 2 years in I would
            say that I finally have a reasonably firm grasp of the core tech stack.
            One of the pieces of advice that I most recently heard which really
            resonated with me is from Mark Richards who recommends trying to expand
            what you know you dont know. Develop your core competencies in your
            direct domain. Additionally start asking questions about how things work
            that are not things your are directly working on. Not because you are
            going to get an in depth answer and know everything about it, but
            because when/if you have to work with it in the future you will know
            that you need to look into it, as opposed to not even knowing it
            existed.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl" font-sans>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            In short I will probably never make a computer in minecraft, or completely
            redo Ocarina of Time to play at 60 fps on original hardware. It is likely
            that my projects outside of work are relatively unremarkable, at least for
            a while. But that is ok. My decision to switch careers was about making a 
            positive move for myself and my family. Not an attempt to be the best 
            programmer in the world or do something truely incredible.
